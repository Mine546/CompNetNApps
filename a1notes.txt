Browser will send absolute uri to the proxy

 The absoluteURI form is REQUIRED when the request is being made to a
   proxy. The proxy is requested to forward the request or service it
   from a valid cache, and return the response. Note that the proxy MAY
   forward the request on to another proxy or directly to the server
   specified by the absoluteURI. In order to avoid request loops, a
   proxy MUST be able to recognize all of its server names, including
   any aliases, local variations, and the numeric IP address. An example
   Request-Line would be:




response will lookmlike this:

   Response      = Status-Line               ; Section 6.1
                       *(( general-header        ; Section 4.5
                        | response-header        ; Section 6.2
                        | entity-header ) CRLF)  ; Section 7.1
                       CRLF
                       [ message-body ]          ; Section 7.2





we will be using localhost
127.0.0.1
as the server we connect to

port is whatever we choose over 1000

Python TCPclient

from socket import *
serverName = 'servername'
serverPort = 1010
clientSocket = socket(AF_INET,SOCK_STREAM)

clientSocket.connect((serverName,serverPort))
sentence = input('Input lowercase sentence:')
clientSocket.send(sentence.encode())
modifiedSentence = clientSocket.recv(1024)
print('From Server:', modifiedSentence.decode())
clientSocket.close()


Python TCPServer

from socket import *
serverPort = 1010
serverSocket = socket(AF_INET,SOCK_STREAM)
serverSocket.bind(('',serverPort))

serverSocket.listen(1)
print ('The server is ready to receive')


while True:
    connectionSocket, addr = serverSocket.accept()

    sentence = connectionSocket.recv(1024)
    capitalizedSentence = sentence.upper()
    connectionSocket.send(capitalizedSentence)
    connectionSocket.close()
